# Equivalence of family of types and fibration

This paper is based on [MMCS SFEDU thesis](https://github.com/mmcs-sfedu/mmcs_sfedu_thesis)

## Annotation

In this paper I report on formalizing a Moebius strip and on porting a proof of equivalence of fibration and family of types using the proof assistant Arend. The former task is a demonstration of basic Arend features and the latter is an evidence of a correspondence between basic constructions of homotopy and type theories. The code can be found in Arend Groupoid Infinity repository (moebius strip: [Moebius.ard](https://github.com/groupoid/arend/blob/master/src/Moebius.ard), proof: [Fiber.ard](https://github.com/groupoid/arend/blob/master/src/Fiber.ard).
